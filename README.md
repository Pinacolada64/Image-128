## Design goals

### BASIC

* Use more BASIC 7.0 commands where possible

### ML

* `&,9`: fix outputting numeric variables to window
* update `ak$` (seperator line) whenever `ll%` (user line length) changes
* `Â£g_x_`: put value of key pressed into `kp%` after key hit. This eliminates `an=asc(an$+nl$)`, or similar code.
* output to the VDC for 80 column sysop screen

## BASIC 7.0 Notes

* `asc("")` has been fixed to return `0`, not `?illegal quantity error`, so no need to append `nl$` as above
